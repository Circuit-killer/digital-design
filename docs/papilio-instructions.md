# Loading a Circuit on the Papilio

This section describes how to a program a Papilio's FPGA with a synthesized design (`.bit` file).

## Prerequisites

* A Papilio Pro development board and USB cable (other Papilio boards ought to work, too).

* A Xilinx programming file (`.bit`), generated using [these instructions](synthesis-instructions.md).

* A working copy of the `papilio-prog` tool ([installation instructions here](install-instructions.md)).

## Steps

#### 1. Connect the Papilio via USB

#### 2. Verify the connection

#### 3. Locate the programming file

#### 4. Program the device
